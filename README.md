# ToDo App
*Damn obvious thing to find here*

TODO: Make ToDo App usable!


Things are changing from time to time. This was an old project to train my nodeJS skills, buried in the darkest depth of my HDD. Now i decided to restore it as part of my developer's portfolio.

EXTRA: it can show weather forecast based on IP or  user input. Based on mapQuest, darkSky and geoIP APIs. There were some keys unintentionally commited, but they all are already revoked.
